                07gains is an Old School RuneScape goal tracking application. Here you will be able to track multiple characters and set goals for them.</br>
                Be it stats, items, quest or achievements. </br>
                </br>
                Please note that this is an alpha build and somethings will not work or make sense. Some features will be here oneday and gone the next. </br>
                I am currently the only developer working on this project, and I am doing it for fun. If you have a good suggestion, I will try to implement it the best I can. </br>
                </br>
                Also, while this site is secured using SSL and strong password algorithms and a private database, it is best that you do NOT use your password affiliated with RuneScape. PERIOD. <br>
                </br>
